INSTALLATION

Paste the Better Stats GUI folder into the mods folder of your PAYDAY 2 game. If you are lacking that folder you need to install either the BLT or BLT:CSE LUA hook.



USE

By default the mod is enabled and you can set a keybind to toggle it on and off in mod options. This mod allows you to see additional information via popups when you mouse over the stats area. There are different popups for each stat on weapons, as well as popups for weapon mods, armor, grenades, and equipment when mousing over them.



UNINSTALLING

Remove the Better Stats GUI folder from your mods folder. You should leave the mods folder unless you do not have any mods left after uninstalling Better Stats GUI.



BIG shout-out to Seven for doing a good chunk of the work on this, there is virtually chance this could have been done without him. Also if you actually read all of this you are than cooler 95% of everyone else and probably just saved someone else about 5 minutes answering a dumb question.
