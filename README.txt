INSTALLATION

Paste contents of entire folder into your top level Payday 2 folder, found in your Steam directory. It is recommended that you overwrite your IPHLPAPI.dll if present, but make sure you do not remove it if other mods rely on it and you uninstall this mod.



USE

By default enhanced statistics are enabled, you can press F9 to cycle through the three modes: Enhanced Statistics, Index Statistics, and Mod Disabled. Enhanced Statistics is where most of the functionality of the mod can be used, it allows you to see the information in the popups. Index Statistics allows you to see the index stats of weapon, which is the value that the game uses to actually determine resultant spread, damage, recoil, etc. This is additionally useful for seeing hidden Stability modifiers on Weapons that have a base Stability of 20 when looking at what weapon mod to equip. Finally, the third mode simply turns the mod off completely, in case you wish to compare with others who do not have the mod.



UNINSTALLING

Remove the lib/Lua/BetterWeaponStatsMod.lua file and lib/Lua/BetterWeaponStatsMod folder from your Payday 2 directory. If you have Hox Hud or any other lua mod make sure to leave IPHLPAPI.dll, otherwise it is safe to remove it.



BIG shout-out to Seven for doing a good chunk of the work on this, there is virtually chance this could have been done without him. Also if you actually read all of this you are than cooler 95% of everyone else and probably just saved someone else about 5 minutes answering a dumb question.
