INSTALLATION

Paste contents of entire folder into your top level Payday 2 folder, found in your Steam directory. It is recommended that you overwrite your IPHLPAPI.dll if present, but make sure you do not remove it if other mods rely on it and you uninstall this mod.



USE

By default enhanced statistics are enabled, you can press F9 to toggleenhanced statistics as well as the pop up boxes giving extra information. F8 allows you to see the index stats of weapon, which is the value that the game uses to actually determine resultant spread, damage, recoil, etc; it does not currently work on the weapon mod screen, however this functionality will be added in a future version.



UNINSTALLING

Remove lib/Lua/BetterWeaponStatsMod.lua and the lib/Lua/BetterWeaponStatsMod folder from your Payday 2 directory. If you have Hox Hud or any other lua mod make sure to leave IPHLPAPI.dll, otherwise it is safe to remove it.



BIG shout-out to Seven for doing a good chunk of the work on this, there is virtually chance this could have been done without him. Also if you actually read all of this you are than cooler 95% of everyone else and probably just saved someone else about 5 minutes answering a dumb question.
