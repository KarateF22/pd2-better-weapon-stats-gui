INSTALLATION

Paste contents of entire folder into your top level Payday 2 folder, found in your Steam directory. It is recommended that you overwrite your IPHLPAPI.dll if present, but make sure you do not remove it if other mods rely on it and you uninstall this mod.



USE

By default the mod is enabled and you can press F9 to toggle it on and off. This mod allows you to see additional information via popups when you mouse over the stats area. There are different popups for each stat on weapons, as well as popups for weapon mods, armor, and melees when mousing over them.



UNINSTALLING

Remove the lib/Lua/BetterWeaponStatsMod.lua file and lib/Lua/BetterWeaponStatsMod folder from your Payday 2 directory. If you have Hox Hud or any other lua mod make sure to leave IPHLPAPI.dll, otherwise it is safe to remove it.



BIG shout-out to Seven for doing a good chunk of the work on this, there is virtually chance this could have been done without him. Also if you actually read all of this you are than cooler 95% of everyone else and probably just saved someone else about 5 minutes answering a dumb question.
