INSTALLATION

Paste contents of entire folder into your top level Payday 2 folder, found in your Steam directory. If you have HoxHud there is no need to overwrite IPHLPAPI.dll, though overwriting it will not harm it either.



USE

Once in game press F9 to enable enhanced statistics as well as the pop up boxes giving extra information; it can be toggled on or off at any time through use of that key. F8 allows you to see the index stats of weapon, which is the value that the game uses to actually determine resultant spread, damage, recoil, etc; it does not currently work on the weapon mod screen, however this functionality will be added in a future version.



UNINSTALLING

Remove PD2Hook.yml, and the LUA/BetterWeaponStatsMod folder from your Payday 2 directory. If you have Hox Hud, leave IPHLPAPI.dll, otherwise remove it.



BIG shout-out to Seven for doing a good chunk of the work on this, there is virtually chance this could have been done without him. Also if you actually read all of this you are than cooler 95% of everyone else and probably just saved someone else about 5 minutes answering a dumb question.
